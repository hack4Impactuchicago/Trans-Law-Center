<p>Transgender Law Center (TLC) and Hack4Impact-UChicago have developed a tool to help you with the process of filling out court forms to petition for a legal name and/or gender change in California. Use this tool to access printable and fillable blank forms, step-by-step instructions for filling out the forms, and sample filled-out forms. Anyone currently living in California can use these forms and directions. <br>
    </p>
<p>
For more information about the process of obtaining a name and/or gender change and updating your California and federal identification, please refer to TLC’s guide “ID Please!” available at <a href="https://transgenderlawcenter.org/resources/id/id-please">https://transgenderlawcenter.org/resources/id/id-please</a>. <br>
